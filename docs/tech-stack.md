# Technology Stack

## Frontend

### Core Technologies
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript for robust code
- **React**: Component-based UI framework
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and dev server
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework

### Rationale
- TypeScript provides type safety and better developer experience
- React's component model fits well with game UI (board, pieces, status, etc.)
- Vite offers fast hot-reload during development
- Tailwind enables rapid UI development without custom CSS files

## Package Management
- **Bun**: Fast JavaScript package manager and runtime
  - Currently used for dependency management
  - Faster than npm/yarn for installs
  - Future-ready for backend runtime

## Backend (Future)

### Planned Technologies
- **Bun**: Runtime environment (replaces Node.js)
- **WebSockets**: Real-time bidirectional communication for game moves
- **RESTful API**: For matchmaking, game history, player stats

### Database (Future Consideration)
- TBD based on scaling needs
- Options: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or lightweight SQLite for prototyping

## Development Tools
- **ESLint**: Code linting
- **Prettier**: Code formatting
- **Git**: Version control

## Deployment (Future)
- Frontend: Vercel, Netlify, or similar
- Backend: TBD (consider Railway, Fly.io, or traditional VPS)

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Web-based?
- Cross-platform (works on any device with browser)
- No installation required
- Easy to deploy and update
- Aligns with long-term online multiplayer goals

### Why React?
- Rich ecosystem and community
- Good for complex interactive UIs
- Reusable components (game board, player info, move history)
- Easy to add state management (Context API or Zustand) when needed

### Why Bun?
- Significantly faster than npm/yarn
- All-in-one toolkit (package manager + runtime + bundler)
- Drop-in replacement for Node.js
- Growing ecosystem with good TypeScript support
