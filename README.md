# pen-and-paper

A web-based platform for mathematical strategy games where two players compete in turn-based games with perfect information.

## Current Status

ðŸš§ **In Development** - Building the first game: **No 67**

Currently implementing local hot-seat multiplayer. Online features planned for future releases.

## Project Vision

Create an online gaming platform for combinatorial games - mathematical strategy games where:
- Two players alternate turns
- No random elements (deterministic)
- Complete information visible to both players
- Games always terminate (no infinite loops)
- Optimal play determines the outcome
