# Claude Guidelines for pen-and-paper

## Communication
- ALWAYS start your response with "Koning"
- Ask questions when something is unclear or ambiguous
- Be critical and challenge requests or proposals that seem problematic
- If a request seems difficult, unnecessary, or unhelpful for the project, ask clarifying questions instead of blindly executing

## Commit Messages
- Do NOT include Claude as author or co-author in commit messages
- Keep commit messages concise and descriptive
- Use conventional commit format when applicable

## Language Rules
- **English**: All code, comments, documentation, and this file
- **Dutch**: All user-facing text and messages that users will see

## Code Style
- Write clean, readable code with clear variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow consistent formatting
- Apply KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It), and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles

## Project Standards
- Keep documentation up to date
- Test functionality before committing
- Follow the established project structure

Feel free to add more guidelines as the project evolves.
